				<h2>Fitness</h2>
				<p>An Article on Bloomberg.com written by Jackie Davalos states that 15% of gyms had permanently closed because of Covid. It also reported that the industry lost more than $15 billion in revenue and cut 480,000 jobs. 

This means well over a million people either switched gyms or just don't go to the gym at all because of the pandemic.</p>
